Project Overview
This project is a front-end web application developed using React.js, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. It's designed to interact with a remote API to fetch and display a list of books. Each book can be clicked to view more detailed information. This setup demonstrates key front-end development concepts, including API integration, routing, state management, and responsive UI design.

Key Features
Dynamic Data Loading: The application dynamically loads book data from a remote API, ensuring that the content is always up-to-date. This is achieved using the Axios library to handle HTTP requests.
Routing: Implemented with React Router v6, the app includes several routes:
/books: Displays a list of all books. Each book title is a link that leads to a detailed view of the book.
/books/:id: Displays detailed information about a specific book, such as title, ISBN, page count, and authors.
Interactive and User-friendly UI:
Loading States: The application shows a loading indicator while fetching data from the API, enhancing the user experience by providing feedback that the application is processing.
Error Handling: The application gracefully handles and displays errors encountered during API calls, such as network issues or data fetching problems.
Navigational Links: Users can navigate through the application using links without full page reloads, making the interface faster and smoother.
Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be responsive, making it accessible and usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Styling: CSS is used to enhance the visual appearance of the application, featuring a clean and modern aesthetic with a focus on readability and usability. Specific styling includes headers, a well-defined book list, and attractively displayed book details.
Technologies Used
React.js: Used for building the user interface, including components and hooks for managing state and effects.
React Router v6: Handles the routing within the application, allowing navigation between different views without reloading the page.
Axios: Facilitates HTTP requests to fetch data from the backend API.
CSS: Provides styling for the application, enhancing the visual layout and design.
